Need Support?
=============
There is not much to get support for. The extension is very simple and the documentation covers everything. Even so, if there is someone who needs help, he/she can contact me.

Stackoverflow
-------------
Please use https://stackoverflow.com to get the best support. Tags you should use are **`typo3`**. Since the extension uses TYPO3 Core functions and elements, the most experienced developers will be able to help you.

Slack
-----
Find the new channel here:
