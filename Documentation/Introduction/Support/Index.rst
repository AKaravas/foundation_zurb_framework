Need Support?
=============
There is not much to get support for. The extension is very simple and the documentation covers everything. Even so, if there is someone who needs help, he can contact me. 

Stackoverflow
-------------
Please use https://stackoverflow.com to get best support. Tags you should use are `typo3`. The most experienced developers will be able to help you, since the extension uses TYPO3 Core functions and elements.

Slack
-----
Later on, a slack channel will be created. I first need to find the time to do so.

.. note::

   If you are not yet registered, use http://forger.typo3.org/slack for that!

Sponsoring
----------
If you need a feature which is not yet implemented, feel free to contact me anytime!
